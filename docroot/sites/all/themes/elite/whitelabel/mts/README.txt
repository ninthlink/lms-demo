The 'whitelabel' directory holds styles and images that can be used to turn the
elite theme into a whitelabel version of itself.

ENABLING
--------
1. In the theme settings (/admin/appearance/settings/elite), click the 'Toggle styles'
tab, then enable the 'Whitelabel specific styles' stylesheet.
2. Also in the theme settings, set the Logo path to the following:
sites/all/themes/elite/whitelabel/logo.png
3. Disable the 'Footer Copyright' block.

GUIDELINES FOR UPDATING
-----------------------
As a general rule, keep the styles in whitelabel.css as minimal as possible.

If significant changes are required that cannot be kept inside the whitelabel directory,
consider creating a separate whitelabel subtheme instead.
