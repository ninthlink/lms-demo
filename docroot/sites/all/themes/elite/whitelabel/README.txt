The 'whitelabel' directory contains a directory for each whitelabel version of the
elite theme.  Each of these directories contain styles and images that can be used
to turn the elite theme into a whitelabel version of itself.

GUIDELINES FOR UPDATING
-----------------------
As a general rule, keep the styles in whitelabel.css as minimal as possible.

If significant changes are required that cannot be kept inside the whitelabel directory,
consider creating a separate whitelabel subtheme instead.
